I wrote the tests after i implemented the endpoint, so I'd already done a bunch of checking to see which conditions caused errors
and which were successful.  When I wrote tests, I wrote them to match the various error conditions I had discovered in my investigation,
for example, that page numbers could not be multiples of 3 or 5, and that not-a-numbers weren't valid for page or nbrItems.  
I also made sure that it would default to 10 items per page in the event that nbrItems was not provided, and that requests for data
items beyond the 100 provided would not error.

I wrote the tests against the provided endpoint and then also configured them so that they could be run against my own endpoint to
check for consistent behavior.  If you'd like to run the tests on my own app, just comment out line 4 and uncomment lines 6, 7, and
124.  I used tap to write the tests, and the test script tag is present in package.json so npm test will run them (or tap test, 
either will work).
